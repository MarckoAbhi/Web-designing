        <h2><u style="color:#3b1439">Department of computer science</u></h2>
        <p>The Department offers B.Sc. (H) Computer Science, Generic Elective for students of other courses and
            Discipline Course to B.A. (P). <br>The Department has been actively engaged in a myriad of curricular and
            extra-curricular activities throughout the year. The Department <br>also hosts the Centre for Robotics and
            Artificial Intelligence, and Centre for Social Innovation.

            The Department, with the current faculty <br>strength of six Assistant Professors, sufficiently caters to its
            requisite teaching and research requirements. Moreover, in order to cater to <br>the requirements of
            interdisciplinary courses, guest teachers from institutes such as IIT Delhi, JNU, and other colleges of
            University of <br>Delhi are regularly invited, as per requirements.</p>

        <h2><u>Department of Mathematic</u></h2>
        <p>The Department of Mathematics, Ramanujan College is well known for its dedication towards excellence in
            teaching and research. <br>Named after the great Indian Mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, the Department
            upholds his spirit of Mathematical Excellence <br>and Innovation. The Department of Mathematics was established
            in 1966. The Department used to handle the Discipline course of B.A.<br>(Programme) and few courses (Business
            Statistics and Business Mathematics) of B. Com.(H). In the academic session 2013-2014, the <br>Department of
            Mathematics offered Honours degree course in Mathematics under the FYUP (Four Year Undergraduate Programme)
            scheme <br>of courses. Initially, the department offered honors course in Mathematics under the FYUP scheme
            which was later re-framed into three year <br>undergraduate course. From 2016-2022, the department admitted
            students in B.Sc. (H) Mathematics pragramme under the Choice based credit <br>system (CBCS) and Learning
            Outcomes-based Curriculum Framework (LOCF) time to time. Currently, the department offering 4 years B.Sc.
            (H) <br>Mathematics programme with Research/Academic Projects/Entrepreneurship under Undergraduate Curriculum
            Framework-2022 (UGCF-2022) <br>scheme of National Education Policy-2020. Apart from the honours course, the
            Department also offers Mathematics as a Discipline Course in <br>B.A. Programme.</p>
        <h2><u>Department of Hindi</u></h2>
        <p>The department is serving different other streams also according to the university guidelines and syllabus.
            Many of our students are working at higher levels in various spheres of life. Our first priority for the
            students is to encourage them for studying Hindi as a subject and language. We have recently worked on many
            projects related to Hindi language and literature with our students. We try to promote Hindi beyond mere
            poetry and prose. We have recently focused on career oriented courses such as media, broadcasting,
            stage-play, film-study etc. The department also involves students in extra-curricular activities like
            literary trip, outreach program etc. The Academic result of the department is almost hundred per cent every
            year. Two students are teaching in University of Delhi as faculty members. The department is getting more
            and more progressive day by day.</p>
        <h2><u>Department of English</u></h2>
        <p>The idea is to evolve an awareness of cultural constructs and ideologies which shape the writing and reading
            of texts, and also to develop a sensitive and nuanced understanding of critical issues affecting the
            individual and society. Since the College has been renamed Ramanujan College in 2010, and been functioning
            as a full-fledged morning college, the Department has extended the mentoring beyond the classroom and texts
            through various multidisciplinary projects and activities like talks, outreach programmes, paper writing,
            national seminars, film screenings and theatre. It encourages the quest for knowledge through research-based
            approach and self-learning in addition to building a student’s ability to analyse, assimilate and express in
            both oral and written modes.</p>
