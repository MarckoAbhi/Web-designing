            in 1966. The Department used to handle the Discipline course of B.A.(Programme) and few courses (Business
            Statistics and Business Mathematics) of B. Com.(H). In the academic session 2013-2014, the Department of

            Many of our students are working at higher levels in various spheres of life. Our first priority for the

            as a full-fledged morning college, the Department has extended the mentoring beyond the classroom and texts
            through various multidisciplinary projects and activities like talks, outreach programmes, paper writing,
            national seminars, film screenings and theatre. It encourages the quest for knowledge through research-based
            approach and self-learning in addition to building a student's ability to analyse, assimilate and express in
            both oral and written modes.</p>
        <h2 id="Commerce"><u>6-Department of Commerce</u></h2>
        <p>The department not only covers the commerce courses but also caters to the needs of the students of B. A.
            (Prog.) by offering discipline courses in Accounting and Finance and Entrepreneurship and Small Business

            <h2><u>About Us</u></h2>
            <p>Inspired by Srinivasa Aiyangar Ramanujan, one of the worldâs greatest-ever mathematical genius, the
                College
                adheres to the core values of dedication, hard work and commitment as encapsulated in the motto of the
                University of Delhi â Nistha, Dhriti and Satyam.

                Ramanujan College, formerly known as Deshbandhu College (Evening), was established in 1958 by the
                Ministry
                of Rehabilitation, Government of India, in the memory of Late Lala Deshbandhu Gupta, a patriot who had
                dedicated his life to the national freedom struggle. The College is 100% funded by the University Grants
                Commission (UGC) and has been maintained by the University of Delhi since 1972. The College opened its
                gate
                for women students in 1994. In 2010, the Deshbandhu College (Evening) was renamed as the Ramanujan
                College.
                The College became a full-fledged day college since 2012.

                For the past decade, the college has been on a path of unprecedented growth. With the introduction of
                many
                new courses, and a rapidly expanding infrastructure that seeks to provide the latest facilities, the
                college
                boldly looks forward to new challenges of the future.
