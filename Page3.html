    <h2>First come First serve</h2>
    <p>First Come First Serve CPU Scheduling Algorithm shortly known as FCFS is the first algorithm of CPU Process
        Scheduling Algorithm. In First Come First Serve Algorithm what we do is to allow the process to execute in
        linear manner.

        This means that whichever process enters process enters the ready queue first is executed first. This shows that
        First Come First Serve Algorithm follows First In First Out (FIFO) principle.

        The First Come First Serve Algorithm can be executed in Pre Emptive and Non Pre Emptive manner. Before, going
        into examples, let us understand what is Pre Emptive and Non Pre Emptive Approach in CPU Process Scheduling.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Pre Emptive Approach</h2>
    In this instance of Pre Emptive Process Scheduling, the OS allots the resources to a Process for a predetermined
    period of time. The process transitions from running state to ready state or from waiting state to ready state
    during resource allocation. This switching happens because the CPU may assign other processes precedence and
    substitute the currently active process for the higher priority process.

    <h2>Non Pre Emptive Approach</h2>
    In this case of Non Pre Emptive Process Scheduling, the resource cannot be withdrawn from a process before the
    process has finished running. When a running process finishes and transitions to the waiting state, resources are
    switched.

    <h2>Convoy Effect In First Come First Serve (FCFS )</h2>
    Convoy Effect is a phenomenon which occurs in the Scheduling Algorithm named First Come First Serve (FCFS). The
    First Come First Serve Scheduling Algorithm occurs in a way of non preemptive way.

    The Non preemptive way means that if a process or job is started execution, then the operating system must complete
    its process or job. Until, the process or job is zero the new or next process or job does not start its execution.
    The definition of Non Preemptive Scheduling in terms of Operating System means that the Central Processing Unit
    (CPU) will be completely dedicated till the end of the process or job started first and the new process or job is
    executed only after finishing of the older process or job.

    There may be a few cases, which might cause the Central Processing Unit (CPU) to allot a too much time. This is
    because in the First Come First Serve Scheduling Algorithm Non Preemptive Approach, the Processes or the jobs are
    chosen in serial order. Due, to this shorter jobs or processes behind the larger processes or jobs takes too much
    time to complete its execution. Due, to this the Waiting Time, Turn Around Time, Completion Time is very high.
